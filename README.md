MEGAPONY3000
============
A Responsive Framework with focus on resuable CSS Objects and built-in Element Queries. Not a single media query is used.


How do you use it
-------------------------
Please clone the repo and check out the demo. I haven't put very much time into the demo yet. More infos are coming soon.


Important Notices
-------------------------
* Javascript is a requirement of this framework. The page won't break if Javascript is disabled, but the features won't work either.
* Responsive Resizing will NOT work for few cases. Reload the page please, resizing is no real-world issue. Orientation change event should fire (not tested yet)
* This Repo has an EARLY ALPHA state (proper testing was made but bugs are expected)
* There are issues with the access of document.styleSheets and cssRules (for example in Chrome/Windows) when the framework is running in local filesystem


Special thanks to
-------------------------
* The jQuery guys, Chris Coyier (fitVids), Dmitry Semenov (magnific popup), John Polacek (stacktable), Philipp Bergsmann (CssSelectorNormalizer)
* The unknown copyright owner of the horse image I use from google images.
