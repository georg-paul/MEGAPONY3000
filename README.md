Important Notices
-------------------------
* This Repo is not even on an EARLY ALPHA state and no proper testing was made (bugs are expected)
* You may NOT have /* */ comments in your css output files. The css parser will probably stop working otherwise.
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4208530/xmlhttprequest-origin-null-is-not-allowed-access-control-access-allow-for-file
* Responsive Resizing will NOT work for few cases. Reload the page please, resizing is no real-world issue. Orientation change event should fire (not tested yet)


Special thanks to
-------------------------
* the guys who made the contributed stuff I use in this repo.
* Clearleft - I used most of their styleguide content (http://clearleft.com/styleguide/)
* the unknown copyright owner of the horse image I use.
